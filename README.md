## Overview

### Part 1: Dataset Selection and Initial Analysis

Contains:

- 1.1 Dataset Documentation
- 1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
- 1.3 Biological Relevance
- 
[Here](https://github.com/arianaresi/Machine-learning-approaches-in-RNA-seq-data/blob/main/Part1/DataSelectionAndEDA.md) is a folder containing scripts and explanations of the outputs of each of the steps mentioned above.

And the required files for reproducibility are in [Part 1 folder](https://github.com/arianaresi/Machine-learning-approaches-in-RNA-seq-data/blob/main/Part1).

**Part 2: Machine Learning Approach**

It is a folder containing scripts and explanations of the outputs of each of the steps mentioned below, you can check out it in the [Trimming directory](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/tree/main/Trimming).

In addition, each of the specific steps during the Trimming process can be reviewed by clicking on the desired title:

   - [Fastqc](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/Trimming/FastQC_trimmed.md)
   - [Multiqc](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/Trimming/MultiQC_trimmed.md)

**Part 3: Literature Review**

It is a folder containing scripts and explanations of the outputs of each of the steps mentioned below, you can check out it in the [Alignment](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/tree/main/Alignment) directory.

   - [Definition and workflow](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/Alignment/Definition%20and%20workflow.md)
   - [STAR index](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/Alignment/STAR_index.md)
   - [STAR alignment](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/Alignment/STAR_alignment.md)
  
**Part 4: Implementation and Results**

The complete code diretory can be found [here](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/tree/main/R%20analysis).

A single code was made for import data into R, Normalization and Batch effect correction / DGE analysis you can check out it [here](https://github.com/arianaresi/RNA-seq-Project/blob/main/R%20analysis/script_complet.txt).
